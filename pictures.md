## Placeholder Content

Currently, the site uses placeholder image paths. Once you add the actual images to the `/public` directory, the site will automatically display them. The current placeholder images from the old Astro site are being referenced but may not exist in the new structure.

## Next Steps

1. Add the required images to the `/public` directory
2. Test the site to ensure all images load correctly
3. Update any additional image references as needed
4. Consider adding more images for future blog posts or portfolio items
