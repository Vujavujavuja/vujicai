PERSONAL INFO OBJECT (from content.ts)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

name:
"Nemanja Vujić"

title:
"Data Scientist & AI Engineer"

location:
"Pančevo, Serbia"

company:
"Vega IT"

bio:
"I'm a **Data Scientist & AI Engineer** from Pančevo, Serbia – currently working on advanced AI projects at **Vega IT** in Belgrade. I specialize in building **smart, scalable, and production-ready AI systems** that solve real-world problems using **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Generative AI**, and **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems**."

about:
"I'm obsessed with **AI research**, especially the latest in **LLMs, generative models, and prompt engineering**. My journey into AI started with **annotating LLM outputs** and evolved into developing **full-scale ML pipelines, model evaluations, and RAG architectures**. I help companies implement **ChatGPT-like systems**, **AI chatbots**, and **intelligent document processing** using cutting-edge **natural language processing** techniques."

skills:
"My main language is **Python for AI and Machine Learning**. I use libraries like **LangChain, LangGraph, PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy**, and more. I've worked with vector databases like **FAISS and Milvus** to create **semantic search engines and RAG pipelines**. I'm also confident in model monitoring with **MLflow and Weights & Biases**, including **A/B testing setups** for production ML models. I specialize in **fine-tuning language models**, **prompt optimization**, and **AI system architecture**."

experience:
"My **cloud AI experience** spans across:
• **Azure**: OpenAI GPT-4, AI Studio, Cognitive Services, AI Foundry
• **GCP**: Vertex AI, Natural Language AI, PaLM API
• **AWS**: Bedrock, Comprehend, Personalize, SageMaker

I frequently use **Docker** for containerization and deployment of machine learning applications across these platforms. I build **enterprise AI solutions**, **conversational AI systems**, and **intelligent automation** tools."

powerlifting:
"I used to compete in **powerlifting** and placed **4th nationally** in Serbia's Junior -105kg category. These days, I lift models more than weights – but I still chase progress every day. This discipline from competitive sports translates into my systematic approach to **AI model optimization** and **performance tuning**."

mentoring:
"Beyond engineering, I'm passionate about **mentoring and education**. I guide **junior data scientists** at Vega IT and have developed **AI learning labs for high school students**. These programs teach young minds how to leverage AI tools for learning and problem-solving, helping bridge the gap between traditional education and modern AI capabilities. I believe in empowering the next generation with practical AI skills and **responsible AI development**."
