      <h1>👋🫡 Heeelloooo, I'm Nemanja Vujić</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a Data Scientist, AI Engineer, and Consultant from Pančevo, Serbia. I help businesses build powerful AI solutions – from LLMs to recommender systems – and I’m passionate about teaching others along the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey started as a Data Annotator, checking LLMs and writing prompts. After a detour through DevOps and QA, I found my way back to AI, earned Azure certifications, and joined Vega IT to work on cutting-edge GenAI projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also mentor aspiring data scientists, and in a past life, I competed as a powerlifter – 4th place in Serbia’s Junior -105kg class.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site is where I share my thoughts on AI, engineering, and the occasional squat PR.
