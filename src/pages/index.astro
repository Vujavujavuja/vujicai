      <h1>🤖👋 Hey there, I'm Nemanja Vujić</h1>
      
      <p>🌍 I'm a Data Scientist & AI Engineer from Pančevo, Serbia – currently working on advanced AI projects at <strong>Vega IT</strong> in Belgrade. I specialize in building smart, scalable, and production-ready AI systems that solve real-world problems.</p>

      <p>🧠 I’m obsessed with AI research, especially the latest in LLMs, generative models, and prompt engineering. My journey into AI started with annotating LLM outputs and evolved into developing full-scale ML pipelines, model evaluations, and RAG architectures.</p>

      <p>🛠️ My main language is <strong>Python</strong>. I use libraries like <strong>LangChain, LangGraph, PyTorch, Pandas, NumPy</strong>, and more. I’ve worked with vector DBs like <strong>FAISS</strong> and <strong>Milvus</strong> to create semantic search engines and RAG pipelines. I'm also confident in model monitoring with <strong>MLflow</strong> and <strong>Weights & Biases</strong>, including A/B testing setups for production ML models.</p>

      <p>☁️ My cloud experience spans across:
        <br/>— <strong>Azure</strong>: OpenAI, AI Studio, Cognitive Services, AI Foundry
        <br/>— <strong>GCP</strong>: Vertex AI, Natural Language AI
        <br/>— <strong>AWS</strong>: Bedrock, Comprehend, Personalize
        <br/>I frequently use <strong>Docker</strong> for containerization and deployment of machine learning applications across these platforms.
      </p>

      <p>👨‍🏫 Beyond engineering, I enjoy mentoring junior data scientists and guiding AI interns. Teaching reinforces my knowledge, and it’s deeply rewarding to support others as they enter the field.</p>

      <p>🎯 My goal? To become a top-tier AI Solution Architect and continue pushing the boundaries of intelligent systems – while staying humble, curious, and always ready to learn (and teach!).</p>

      <p>🏋️ Fun fact: I used to compete in powerlifting and placed 4th nationally in Serbia’s Junior -105kg category. These days, I lift models more than weights – but I still chase progress every day.</p>
